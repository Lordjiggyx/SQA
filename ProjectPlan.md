## Process & Tasks

**These are the steps that we plan to execute to complete this project**
1. Each member will fork and clone the repository to their local device and configure their branches
2. Each member will create a feature branch which will be named after a topic
3. Each member will work on a certain topic making regular commits and pushing their changes
4. Pull requests will be mad in order to review team members commits
5. After review if no issues are present then pull request will be merged onto the develop branch
6. Overall review will take place when document is complete.


## Documents Format
* Each topic will have a definition
* Each topic will highlight best practices and possible benefits, of following these practices
* Corresponding mistakes or bad practices for each topic will be in a separate file accessed by a quick link
* Images can be used but not necessary if so an Images folder containing the images used in each topic file should be committed and pushed.
 
 
## Style Guide
* H1 for page title
* H2 for sub-titles "Best Practices / Bad Practices / Benefits / References"
* H3 for question before definition e.g "What are Coding Standards"
* Bullet points should not be numbered
* Bullet points should not have any heading just bolded followed by text
* ["Home Page"](README.md) Quick link should be in every file
* Corresponding quick links between files should be placed to ease navigation
* Center Images 
 
  ## What would we do differently the next time?
* Take advantage of more of GitHub features. E.g. Add reviewers to a pull request, use the approve option to approve a pull request and add labels to a pull request.
* Don't delete merged feature branches, leave them for a longer time so that any issues can be traced back to specific branches and be resolved.
* Install spell checker extension to avoid spelling errors.
* Let 2 or more people work on the same branch if necessary, instead of creating separate files or folders and then having to move things around in a separate pull request.
* Discuss style guide at the start to avoid having to largely remodel document.
* Use one folder for images to prevent images files from not loading due to being in different directories.
* Make more commits in a feature branch and then in pull request describe the changes made, more clearly rather than having multiple feature branches.
* Make use of GitHub "projects" tab , this would have allowed us plan the document better and see what tasks are in the process of being completed or have been completed.
