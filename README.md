Because there is more than one programmer looking over your work, it results in better code.
 
* **Sharing Knowledge**
Developers working together share knowledge amongst themselves which is better than accessing online tutorials etc. Developers can also pick up best practices and better techniques from more advanced developers.
 
* **Develops your staffâ€™s interpersonal skills**
Collaborating on a single project helps your team to appreciate the value of communication and teamwork.
