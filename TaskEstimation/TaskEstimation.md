# Task Estimation

#### What is task estimation?

It is the process of measuring the complexity (size) of stories in an Agile project.  
The basic unit of measure is *Story Points* (SP). It is used to measure the size of the story, much the same like a kilogram is used to find out how heavy an object is.
