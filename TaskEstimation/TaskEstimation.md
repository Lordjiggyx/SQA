# Task Estimation

#### What is task estimation?

It is the process of measuring the complexity (size) of stories in an Agile project.  
The basic unit of measure is *Story Points* (SP). It is used to measure the size of the story, much the same like a kilogram is used to find out how heavy an object is.

During task estimation meetings, the team looks at a list of tasks and estimates the effort required for each of them to be completed. It enables the team to have a shared perspective of the user stories and requirements in order to estimate an accurate value for the effort required. The information developed in such meetings will also be used to determine the velocity for the Sprint.

A task is the main unit of planning and usually should have the following criteria:
* Provide business value
* Be estimable
* Be small enough
* Be testable
