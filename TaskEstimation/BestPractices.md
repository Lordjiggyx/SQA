# Best Practices

* **Engage the whole team**  
  By giving everyone a chance to be involved in the estimation process you gain the benefits of having <ins>different insights</ins> and <ins>different perspectives</ins> on estimating a task. Essentially it generates a better consensus and commitment for the estimates being produced.

* **Use multiple techniques**  
  It is important to use multiple techniques or methods for estimating a task (e.g. planning poker, bottom-up, user story points, etc.) and look for similarities between multiple approaches to make sure the estimates are more accurate.

* **Agree on the definition of "Done"**  
  Make sure everyone agrees on a definition of done. It can mean:  
  * Coded and tested
  * Integrated and tested
  * Integrated, tested and closed the JIRA task
  * etc.

* **Know when to stop**  
  Estimating is not an exact science and it can be exhausting estimating an unpredictable task that can change because of evolving requirements. Make sure to get a <ins>broad consensus</ins> between team members. It is better to save time on estimation for potential periodic updates than wasting too much time now.

* **Estimation is a continuous process**  
  The initial estimate is not the final estimate. To avoid high levels of uncertainty, <ins>periodically review</ins> any uncertain estimates based on new information or requirements received.

* **Aim to understand each other**  
  Accept estimate values as long as there is a good rationale agreement. If there is any conflict, it must be handled within the team by understanding the reason for disagreement and adjust estimate values accordingly.

* **Use non-linear scale**  
  It is better to use a non-linear scale such as in the Fibonacci sequence, (e.g. 1,4,9,16). That is because it is quite hard to judge the difference in a linear scale between 3 and 4 compared to judging the difference between  4 and 9. To avoid number bias, clothes sizes can also be used (e.g. S,M,L,XL).
