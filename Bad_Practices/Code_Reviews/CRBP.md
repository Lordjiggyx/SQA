# Bad Practices - Code Reviwes

* **Review Code Not People**  
When reviewing others code it is best to remember that it is not a competition to see who can code better. Software developers are often proud of thier solutions and take criticism personally on occasion. Reviews help us see how others thought process occurs and feedback gievn should be constructive uplifing and insightful to help others program more efficiently. Be careful to always provide feedback that does not question the person but questions how and why they created a solution the way they did.

* **Styling Conventions**  
The team should decide on how they want to style their code, your teams code should be consistent and look relatively the same. Not having a style guide placed can lead to changes being disapproved during code reviews due to nitpicking about the slightest of cosmetic issues. As someone submitting your code for review you should make sure that it already conforms to the standards you as a team agreed upon. Style-guide violations will be caught in reviews but are a waste of time for both you and the reviewers involved.


* **Meaningful comments**  
If a person makes an error while programming it is almost certain that this error has been repeated across in other parts. When reviewing others code do not point out every occurence of the error instead leave a detailed not explaining the overall issue. It is essential to reply to all comments in order to ensure that the review process is actually being completed.

* **Follow Up on Feedback**  
Feedback is useless if it is not taken to heart. When the review rounds and discussions have finished make sure that you follow up on what was agreed upon. This means making changes to your code and triggering another round of reviews for people to have a look at the newest changes. The same principle of properly splitting up and documenting your commits applies here. If you don’t agree with a given comment don’t be afraid to challenge it, productive discussions are beneficial for each party involved.
