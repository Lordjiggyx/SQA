# Code Reviews

### What is a code review?

A code review is the process by which programmers examine the code of their peers. In order to share knowledge with each other as well as 
checking for bugs and to estimate the code quality. It has been shown to accelerate and streamline the software development process.

A code review inolves checking for things like :
 * Obvious logic errors in the code.
 * Have the requirements for each use case been implemented?
 * Are the current tests sufficient for the new code, will new tests need to be written?

### Benefits of code reviews :

 * Teaching and sharing knowledge, carrying out regular code reviews allows for each team member to get an overview of the existing code meaning each member will learn what parts already exist and what can be reused. It also allows for Junior Developers to be mentored by the other members of the team as it helps the team facilitate conversations about the code base. Since code reviewed for every team member it can also be less intimidating for Junior Developers to have their code reviews although they may get more comments on their code than the rest of the team at first however this is all part of the learning process that will help improve their skills. It also helps develop the skills of the other team members as knowing that your code will be reviewed by your peers will make you aim to produce code of a higher standard and receiving feedback and constructive criticism will also in aide in your learning as a developer.

 * Code reviews make for better estimates. When a scrum team conducts their sprint planning they discuss the upcoming user stories and give an estimate of how much effort will be required to implement a feature. If only the original developer has seen the code that they have worked on. When a new feature is going to be added to their existing code it would be hard for the rest of the team to give feeback and a good estimate of how much effort will be required. However when code is reviewed on a regular basis each code reviewer has evaluated and looked at the complexity and the known issues concerning the area of the code base. This means that each reviewer will have knowledge of that part of the code base and can provide an informed and accurate estimate for the user story.
 
 * Code reviews enable bugs to be found earlier in the development process as programmers are human they can make mistakes and small issues can go unoticed. However code reviewers will look for common bugs espicially ones that notoriusly difficult to find after-the-fact. The benefit of finding these bugs earlier is that it is a lot cheaper the earlier the bug is fixed and it is more than twice as expensive to resolve a bug in QA than it is in development.

 * Code reviews enable time off since knowledge is shared across the project amongst each team member through code reviews. Each member of the team will have have an understanding of what their peers are working on meaning there isn't a reliance on a single team member for a piece of code and that any other team member should be able to take over their work. Allowing for team members to take time off when needed.
