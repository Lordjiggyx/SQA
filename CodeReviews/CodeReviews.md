# Code Reviews

### What is a code review?

A code review is the process by which programmers examine the code of their peers. In order to share knowledge with each other as well as 
checking for bugs and to estimate the code quality. It has been shown to accelerate and streamline the software development process.

A code review involves checking for things like :
 * Obvious logic errors in the code.
 * Have the requirements for each use case been implemented?
 * Are the current tests sufficient for the new code, will new tests need to be written?

### Benefits of code reviews :

#### Teaching and sharing knowledge
 * Carrying out regular code reviews allows for each team member to get an overview of the existing code meaning each member will learn what parts already exist and what can be reused. It also allows for Junior Developers to be mentored by the other members of the team as it helps the team facilitate conversations about the code base. Since code reviewed for every team member it can also be less intimidating for Junior Developers to have their code reviewed. 

#### Code reviews make for better estimates
 * When code is reviewed on a regular basis each code reviewer has evaluated and looked at the complexity and the known issues concerning the area of the code base. Each reviewer will have knowledge of that part of the code base and can provide an informed and accurate estimate for the user story.

#### Enables bugs to found earlier
 * Code reviews enable bugs to be found earlier in the development process as programmers are human they can make mistakes and small issues can go unnoticed. The benefit of finding these bugs earlier is that it is a lot cheaper the earlier the bug is fixed and it is more than twice as expensive to resolve a bug in QA than it is in development.
