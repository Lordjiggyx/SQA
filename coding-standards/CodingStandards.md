## Coding Standards

Coding standards or coding conventions are a tool used by software developers to enforce consistency among team members within a project. These standards include guidelines, best practices and conventions that programmers should adhere to. Every developer should follow some set of coding standards, whether working on a solo project or in a large team. Coding standards are very beneficial when working on software projects.

Benefits of implementing a Coding Standard

- ### Readability.

  - Adherence to coding standards allows oneâ€™s code to be better understood.
  - Self-Explanatory code shortens and simplifies the review process.
  - Reduces the need for verbose commenting to describe what each component does.


- ### Less Duplication.

  - Following conventions can reduce inadvertent or deliberate code duplication.
  - With consistent naming conventions and clear logic that will be easily understood, cloned functionality is less likely.
  - This promotes code re-use across the team which speeds up development.


- ### Maintainability.

  - Following standards means that project maintainability in the future is possible
  - Code is predictable.
  - The source code appears as if it was written by one person in one sitting, rather than many bits of mismatched code stuck together.
